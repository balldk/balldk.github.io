You are assisting in a Svelte 5 project. You must exclusively use Svelte 5 features, such as
- `$state(...)` for state declaration.
- `let {...} = $props()` instead of `export let`
- use `{@render children()}` instead of `<slot />`, where children has the type of `Snippet`.
use bun instead of npm.
Beware of sass breaking changes of using `@import`: https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes/import/
