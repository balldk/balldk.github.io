# About me

<div class="max-w-[50em] text-justify">

Call me **Khoa** (a subword of **Nguyễn Đình Đăng Khoa** in Vietnamese).

<!-- I am a first year PhD student at [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/). My research interests lie in algebraic topology, group cohomology and computational algebraic geometry.

Before joining UVA, -->

I completed bachelor degree in [University of Science - VNU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh_City_University_of_Science). During my undergraduate studies, I had several research experiences:

- I wrote my thesis under the supervision of [Dr. Tuan Anh Bui](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tuan-Bui-8) on the cohomology of $S$-arithmetic groups.
- I joined [Vietnam Polymath REU](https://www.vietnampolymathreu.com/) program with the topic "LOT groups and the Whitehead Conjecture", mentored by [Prof. Thomas Koberda](https://sites.google.com/view/koberdat).
- I worked with [Prof. Tuan Hiep Dang](https://sites.google.com/site/hiepdangmath/) on Reiner-Tudose Conjecture.
- I worked with [Prof. Truong Le Hoang](http://math.ac.vn/vi/component/staff/?task=getProfile&staffID=67) on K-stability condition of Fano variety, funded by VINIF within sponsorship and cooperation program in 2024 between Vietnam Institute of Mathematics and VINIF.

I do [coding](/coding) for fun.
